# ENPM611 GitHub Issues Analyzer

This repository contains an application developed for the ENPM611 class project. The application analyzes GitHub issues from the [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues) open-source project to generate insightful analyses that assist developers.

## Overview

The application focuses on analyzing GitHub issues to help both new and experienced developers contribute effectively to the project. It provides tailored insights based on the developer's experience level:

-   **Feature 1**: Performs Developer-Specific Issue Analysis on poetry_issues.json
-   **Feature 2**: Performs proficiency-based user mentions analysis.
-   **Feature 3**: Provides Insights to active contributors and Community engagement levels

## Features

The application implements three main features (analyses), with the first feature currently developed:

### Feature 1: Developer-Specific Issue Analysis

#### Sub-analysis for New Developers

-   **Description**: Analyzes issues that have a shorter time-to-close, indicating they are easier to resolve.
-   **Output**: Generates a bar chart showing the average time to close issues per label, helping new developers identify suitable issues to work on.

#### Sub-analysis for Experienced Developers

-   **Description**: Analyzes issues with high collaboration levels (more comments and events), which are typically more complex and require experienced input.
-   **Output**:
    -   **Bar Chart**: Displays the top 10 most active labels based on the total number of events/comments.
    -   **Scatter Plot**: Visualizes open issues' complexity, highlighting issues with high collaboration and long open times.

### Feature 2: identifying key contributors by evaluating mention frequency

-   **Description**: This code identifies main contributors in GitHub issues by categorizing users based on their mention frequency. By inputting a username, users can check if a contributor meets the desired mention threshold, indicating their experience level, and visualize the top 10 most frequently mentioned contributors in a bar chart.
-   **Output**:
    -   **Bar Chart**: Displays the top 10 most frequently mentioned users
    -   **prints statement**: Based on the entered username, the program indicates whether the person is a main contributor according to the user-defined mention threshold.

### Feature 3: Contributor and Community Engagement Insights

#### Sub-analysis for Top Contributors LeaderBoard

-   **Description**: Identifies the top contributors based on the number of issues they have created or comments they have made on the issues. This analysis helps to recognize contributors areas of interest and expertise .
-   **Output**: Generates a barchart displaying the top 10 contributors showing their total contributions, which includes issues created and comments made.

#### Sub-analysis for Engagement Levels by Label

-   **Description**: Identifies the labels(issue types) that are most engaging, helping maintainers recognize valuable contributors and understand areas that may require more attention.
-   **Output**:
    -   **Bar Chart**: Displays a bar chart that illustrates engagement levels for different labels, showing which types of issues are more collaborative and attract more attention.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.7 or higher
-   pip (Python package installer)

### Install Dependencies

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

    - On **Windows**:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On **Unix or macOS**:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configure the Data File

1. **Download the data file** (`poetry_issues.json`) from the project assignment on Canvas.
2. **Update the `config.json` file** with the path to the data file:

    ```json
    {
        "data_path": "path/to/poetry_issues.json"
    }
    ```

    Alternatively, you can set an environment variable `ENPM611_PROJECT_DATA_PATH` with the path to the data file to avoid committing personal paths to the repository.

## How to Run the Application

The application is executed via the `run.py` script, using the `--feature` command-line argument to specify which analysis to run. For Feature 1, you can further specify the developer experience level using the `--user` argument.

### Running Feature 0 (Example Analysis)

An example analysis is provided to demonstrate basic functionality:

```bash
python run.py --feature 0
```

### Running Feature 1

#### For New Developers

To run the analysis tailored for new developers:

```bash
python run.py --feature 1 --user new
```

-   **What It Does**: Analyzes issues with a shorter time-to-close and generates a bar chart of labels versus average time to close.
-   **How It Helps**: Helps new developers find issues that are quicker to resolve, easing their onboarding process into the project.

#### For Experienced Developers

To run the analysis tailored for experienced developers:

```bash
python run.py --feature 1 --user experienced
```

-   **What It Does**: Analyzes issues with high collaboration levels and generates:
    -   A bar chart of the top 10 most active labels.
    -   A scatter plot highlighting complex open issues.
-   **How It Helps**: Assists experienced developers in identifying complex issues where their expertise can make a significant impact.

### Running feature 2

```bash
python run.py --feature 2 --mention_threshold 20
```

-   **What It Does**: The program displays a bar graph visualizing the top 10 most-mentioned contributors.
    -   By adjusting the **mention_threshold**, we can filter and view contributors based on their suitability for tasks
    -   You can enter a username to check if the userâ€™s mention count is above or below the specified threshold.
-   **How It Helps**: Helps identify key contributors by evaluating mention frequency to assign task suitability.

### Running Feature 3

```bash
python run.py --feature 3
```

-   **What It Does**: Executes the Contributor and Community Engagement Insights analysis, generating visual insights on top contributors and engagement levels by label.
    -   Top Contributors Leaderboard: Creates a bar chart showcasing the top 10 contributors based on the number of issues created and comments made.
    -   Engagement Levels by Label: Produces a bar chart that shows which issue labels (types) have the highest engagement, indicating where community interest and activity are concentrated.
-   **How It Helps**: This feature provides valuable insights for project maintainers by highlighting the top contributors based on their involvement and identifying labels that attract the most community attention. It helps in recognizing key contributors and understanding areas that may benefit from increased support or attention.

## VSCode Run Configuration

For easier debugging and execution, runtime configurations are provided for VSCode:

1. Open the **Run and Debug** view in VSCode.
2. Choose the desired analysis from the available configurations.
3. Start the debugger to run the selected analysis.

The configurations are specified in the `.vscode/launch.json` file.

## Additional Notes

-   **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to set configuration parameters without modifying the `config.json` file.
-   **Extensibility**: The application is designed to be extensible. New analyses can be added by implementing additional features and updating the `run.py` script accordingly.
-   **Data Model and Utilities**:
    -   `data_loader.py`: Loads issues from the data file into runtime data structures.
    -   `model.py`: Defines the data models for issues and events.
    -   `config.py`: Manages configuration settings, allowing for easy customization.
